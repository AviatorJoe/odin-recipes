    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Serious about steak? So are our chefs! That’s why they took sirloin to the next level by topping it with a
        luxurious pan sauce. Here, roasted garlic and rich beef demi-glace mingle with the fond (aka the crispy bits and
        drippings left in the pan after cooking the meat) to create a condiment you’ll want to drizzle over just about
        everything… especially the chive-flecked mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli on the side.</p>

                <li>Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash with sour cream,
                    salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy, adding reserved potato cooking liquid a splash at a time
                    as needed.</li>

            </ul>
