    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A little inspiration from Palermo, Italy is what sets this penne above and
      beyond. That, and the combo of prosciutto AND chicken (aka ALL the
      meats!). Prepare yourself for this Italian feast: al dente penne, cream
      sauce, peas, crispy prosciutto, tender chicken, and sprinkles of all the
      best garnishes (we’re talking lemon zest, Parm, parsley, and chili
      flakes). No red-eye flight to Italy required!

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Peel and mince or grate garlic. Pick parsley leaves from stems;
            roughly chop leaves. Zest and quarter lemon.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once water is boiling, add penne to pot. Cook, stirring
            occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
            Add prosciutto slices in a single layer; sear until browned and
            crispy, 2-3 minutes per side. TIP: If the prosciutto starts to crisp
            too quickly, reduce heat to medium.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off heat; transfer prosciutto to a paper-towel-lined plate.
            Reserve oil in pan (you’ll use it to cook the chicken in the next
            step).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with salt,
            pepper, and half the Fry Seasoning (all for 4 servings).
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat pan with reserved oil over medium-high heat. (TIP: Add an
            additional drizzle of oil if needed). Add chicken and cook until
            browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a cutting board to rest. Wipe out
            pan.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Heat 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for chicken
            over medium-high heat. • Add garlic; cook, stirring occasionally,
            until fragrant, 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add cream sauce base, cream cheese, a big pinch of salt, and pepper.
            Cook, stirring, 2-3 minutes more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add drained penne and peas. Cook, stirring, until peas are warmed
            through and sauce has slightly thickened, 1-2 minutes more. TIP: If
            needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time
            until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in half the parsley, a big squeeze of lemon juice, and a pinch
            of chili flakes if desired.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Slice chicken crosswise.</li>
          <li>
            Divide pasta between bowls. Top with chicken. Crumble prosciutto
            over top. (TIP: Or crumble half the prosciutto and top the pasta
            with the remaining larger pieces.) Sprinkle with lemon zest,
            Parmesan, remaining parsley, and a pinch of chili flakes to taste.
            Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
